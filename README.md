# Hackathon 2020 

## Goals  

* To develop open source bioinformatics tools to help in genome data preparation, management and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and host genomes. 
* To help you in assimilating the different concepts that you have already developed during the last PHAINDACCESS courses. 
* To create a sustainable community within IPT that helps in designing and developing of bioinformatics tools. 

The most important outcome from this hackathon is to help you learn new skills and that depends on the interactivity level between the different members. 

## Requirements

There is no prior requirement for you to be part in the hackathon. Although, participants are encouraged to shape their knowledge in [LINUX](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/index.htm), [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
